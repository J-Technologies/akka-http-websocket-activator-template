        This template consists of two parts, a theoretical and a hands-on part.
        In the theoretical part you will learn about the techniques mentioned above by means of a fully working example.
        In the hands-on part you will test-drive your own flow.
        So don't mind the failing <a href="#test">tests</a> for now, you will fix them soon enough ;)

    <h2>Part 1: An Overview</h2>

    <p>
        In this tutorial we will use a simple Twitter like application to demonstrate the different techniques. You can
        post a tweet as a user and monitor a reactive timeline that changes whenever a new tweet is posted. We
        simplified
        the functionality a bit to keep the focus on the essentials.
    </p>

    <h3>Posting tweets</h3>

    <p>
        You can post tweets via a simple REST endpoint. A tweet consists of a username and the message. We use
        <strong>Akka Persistence</strong> to keep track of the tweets for each user and be able to recover the
        timeline for a user after a restart of the application. All incoming tweets are put on the event bus that comes
        with <strong>Akka</strong> once they are persisted.
    </p>

    <h3>Streaming tweets via Websockets</h3>

    <p>
        On the other side an actor is subscribed to the event bus. This means the actor will be notified every time a
        new tweet is put on the event bus. Since <strong>Akka</strong> implements the <a
            href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/announce-1.0.0">
        Reactive Streams</a> SPI we can turn the actor into a <strong>Publisher</strong> which we can then turn into a
        <strong>Source</strong> so we can use it in an <strong>Akka Http Flow</strong>.
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>Part 1: Posting a Tweet</h2>

    <p>
        We start in <a href="#code/src/main/scala/reactive/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Main.scala</a> which defines the
        routes. The route (in this case a REST endpoint) for posting a tweet is defined in the following method:

<pre><code>def addTweet = {
  post {
    entity(as[Tweet]) { tweet =>
      complete {
        (system.actorOf(TweetActorManager.props) ? tweet).map(_ => StatusCodes.NoContent)
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

    The interesting part resides within the <code>complete</code> directive. There we create an actor (<a
        href="#code/src/main/scala/reactive/tweets/incoming/TweetActorManager.scala"
        class="shortcut">TweetActorManager</a>)
    and send it the tweet. For simplicity we ignore failure and transform a successful completion to an appropriate
    HTTP status code.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Part 1: Using Akka Persistence</h2>

    <h3>Forwarding tweets to persistent actors</h3>

    <p>
        All posted tweets end up at the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/reactive/tweets/incoming/TweetActorManager.scala"
                                           class="shortcut">TweetActorManager</a>.
        This actor forwards the tweet to a persistent actor based on the user that posted the tweet. Because we
        want to keep track of the last tweets of a user we associate each user with a dedicated persistent actor.
        The job of the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/reactive/tweets/incoming/TweetActorManager.scala" class="shortcut">TweetActorManager</a>
        is to ensure the tweets end up at the correct persistent actor.
    </p>

    <h3>Persisting and recovering tweets</h3>

    <p>
        It is the job of the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/reactive/tweets/incoming/TweetActor.scala" class="shortcut">TweetActor</a>
        to persist the tweet and put it on the event bus. It also knows how to recover the tweets for a user after a
        system failure.

<pre><code>case tweet: Tweet =>
  persist(tweet) { event =>
    sender() ! Status.Success
    context.system.eventStream.publish(tweet)
  }</code></pre>

    After successful storage the callback is triggered. We send out a <code>Success</code> message and publish the tweet
    on the event bus.
    </p>

        Next: <a href="#tutorial/4" class="shortcut">Reactive Streams</a>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Part 1: Reactive Streams</h2>

    <p>
        If we want to stream the tweets via websockets to our users we need to get them from somewhere. That place is
        the
        event bus. However, we need to perform some transformations before <strong>Akka Http</strong> is able to use the
        bus as a source. The first step is hook up an actor to the event bus and expose that actor as a
        <code>Publisher</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.0/README.md#specification">Reactive
        Streams Specification</a> defines a Publisher as<br/>
    </p>

    <blockquote><em>a provider of a potentially unbounded number of sequenced elements, publishing them according to the
        demand received from its Subscriber(s).</em></blockquote>

    <p>
        Akka implements the Reactive Streams SPI and fortunately the code to turn an actor into a Publisher is pretty
        straightforward:
        we just have to extend <code>ActorPublisher</code> which exposes (among others) the <code>onNext</code> which we
        can use to push a new tweet to our subscribers when one arrives. Only thing left is to subscribe to the event
        bus when the
        actor is started. The code can be found in <a
            href="#code/src/main/scala/reactive/tweets/outgoing/TweetPublisher.scala" class="shortcut">TweetPublisher.scala</a>
        and should look like this:
    </p>

<pre><code>class TweetPublisher extends ActorPublisher[Tweet] {

  override def preStart = {
    context.system.eventStream.subscribe(self, classOf[Tweet])
  }

  override def receive = {
    case tweet: Tweet => onNext(tweet)
  }

}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Next: <a href="#tutorial/5" class="shortcut">Running the Flow</a>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Part 1: Running the Flow</h2>

    <p>
        In the previous section we described how to define an actor as a Reactive Streams Publisher. To start streaming
        we still need to instantiate the actor and - in one go - transform it into a Source. This is done in <a
            href="#code/src/main/scala/reactive/tweets/outgoing/TweetFlow.scala" class="shortcut">TweetFlow.scala</a>.

    <pre><code>private val tweetSource: Source[Tweet, ActorRef] =
        Source.actorPublisher[Tweet](TweetPublisher.props)</code></pre>

    Now we've got our hands on a proper <code>Source</code> we can use it to construct a <code>Flow</code>:

        <pre><code>def tweetFlow(tweetFilter: TweetFilter): Flow[Message, Message, Unit] =
            Flow.wrap(Sink.ignore, tweetSource filter tweetFilter map toMessage)(Keep.left)</code></pre>

    Note: ignore the tweetFilter for now, this is just a convenience parameter to be able to construct specific streams,
    like the stream of tweets for a specific user, or the stream of tweets that contain a specific hash tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are only interested in one way communication with our Websocket. We push new tweets to the client on their
        arrival. Theoretically we could also receive messages over the same channel from the client. We just ignore
        those.
        So what does this look like in terms of a Flow?
    </p>

    <pre>
        +-----------------------------+
        | Our Websocket Flow          |
        |                             |
        |  +--------+      +------+   |
        |   \       |      |       \  |
    In ~~>   | SINK |      | SOURCE |~~> Out
        |   /       |      |       /  |
        |  +--------+      +------+   |
        +-----------------------------+
    </pre>

    <p>
        The important thing to note is that the inner parts of the Flow (the Sink and the Source) have no connection
        with each other. Incoming messages from the Websocket are ignored by routing them to the Ignore Sink
        while on the other hand the outgoing channel will be serviced by our transformed actor that is listening to the
        event bus:

    <pre><code>Flow.wrap(Sink.ignore, tweetSource filter tweetFilter map toMessage)(Keep.left)</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Next: <a href="#tutorial/6" class="shortcut">The Websocket</a>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Part 1: The Websocket</h2>

    <p>
        So we have a nice Flow, the next step is plugging it into Akka Http.<br/>
        The most notable part is the <code>handleWebsocketMessages</code> directive, which comes out of the box with Akka Http.
<pre><code>def tweetsOfUserSocket = (pathPrefix("users") & path(Segment)) { userName =>
  handleWebsocketMessages(tweetFlowOfUser(userName))
}</code></pre>

    The part below describes the path at which the Websocket for this Flow can be found: <code>/ws/users/[userName]</code>.

<pre><code>pathPrefix("ws") {
  pathPrefix("tweets") {
    get {
      tweetsOfUserSocket
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    Now we have explained all the pieces you can <a href="#run/system">run</a> the application and see everything in action.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    In the next part you will extend the application with a flow containing only tweets with a certain hash tag.

    <h2>Part 2: Building your own Flow</h2>
    <h3>Implementing a Websocket for tweets with a certain hash tag</h3>
    <p>
    It's time to get your hands dirty. Tweets for a user are nice to have, but having a different channel to only follow
    tweets with a certain hash tag would be even nicer, don't you agree?</p>
    <p>
    In this second part we will create, step by step and test first, this feature for the application. Each step will
    have a failing test and an unimplemented method to help you along the way.
